# ROS2 Demo

ROS2 demo is designed to be interoperable with ROS2 https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/ turtlesim demo.

1. Turtle can be commanded with arrow keys.
2. 'Q' exits the demo

**Note!** Currently RustDDS might not fully work on same machine and this demo might not function properly in that case.
