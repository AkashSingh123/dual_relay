# Shapes Demo Example

This shapes demo example is currently only designed to verify and see compatibility with other DDS implementations.

1. Get some others DDS implementations shapes demo. Eg. https://www.eprosima.com/index.php/products-all/eprosima-shapes-demo
2. Add reader for Square and reader for Triangle.
3. Start shapes demo and use arrow keys to control other implementations triangle. Additionally there should be some messages received visible from the square Topic.
4. To exit shapes demo press 'q' and then 'Crtl + C' 

**Note!** Currently RustDDS might not fully work on same machine and this demo might not function properly in that case.
